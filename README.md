# blogapp_with_users

I made this page with the help of Colt Steels course for web development.

This is intended as a webpage with blog. It also has the option for User sign in and authentication so that every user can create his own blog post and comments.

For this projects I used HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js. And a lot of npm-s and semantic-ui.

You can see the live version on heroku.
